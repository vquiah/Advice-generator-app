# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app

![Design preview for the Advice generator app coding challenge](./advice-generator-app-main/design/active-states.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.


## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## Built With:

-SASS
-Semantic HTML5 markup
-Javascript
-API

## What I learned
Integrating APIs
fetch() Javascript
Promises
Negative margin vs position absolute
Using let vs var vs const

## Continued development
APIs
Positioning in CSS
Useful resources
